**Animerade prototyper som designfilter** - 
*Kan man designa dynamiska interaktioner med statiska prototyper?*

By: Tor Bruce & Simon Johansson

>This study examines how the level of dynamic features of an interactive prototype affects the design feedback. This information is valuable when deciding whether it is worth spending extra resources to develop a prototype containing a high degree of dynamic elements, or if the same type of feedback can be gathered from using a static, i.e. resource light, prototype. To explore this, the study had the following question as its starting point: Are different filtering dimensions explored through a dynamic prototype as opposed to a static prototype? To answer this question, we let twelve interaction design professionals give feedback on two prototypes reflecting the same design, but containing different degrees of dynamic elements. The feedback was then categorized using Lim, Stolterman and Tenenbergs (2008) five filtering dimensions (Appearance, Data, Functionality, Interactivity, Spatial structure) to be able to analyze how, and in what way, the feedback from the two prototypes varied. The research strategy employed was mixed methods; data collection was conducted through
observation and surveys. The results of the study show that the feedback from the two prototypes did not differ in any significant way with the filtering dimensions as the basis for the comparison, as the participants made similar number of improvement proposals for each filtering dimension, regardless of which prototype they were exposed to. The few differences we have seen when comparing the feedback from the two prototypes is consistent with the traditional view of low- and high-fidelity prototypes, namely that a prototype that perceives as being further from the final product evokes criticism regarding the prototypes role, while a more fleshed out prototype leads to detail-oriented feedback. In our work with the filtering dimensions, we have also noticed the lack of a dimension that captures the content of the prototype, which is often an important aspect of the web-based applications.

##About the prototype
This was the dynamic prototype used in the study

###Installing dependencies

```
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

###Starting server

```
grunt
```
The prototype should now be availabe at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Works in webkit-browsers and best in Safari for some reason.
